        <h2><a>Introduction</a></h2>
        <p> Hello and welcome to <strong>The Old Man </strong>, a website created for the purpose of sharing the commentaries of Mr.P. He explains subject matters related to politics, current world events, religion, history and education but his views, sometimes hardline and controversial in this "modern" world require anonymity. And although Mr.P accepts that even the internet does'nt provide complete anonymity these days, it is surely a good stage for his privacy and anonymity to some extent. </p>
        <h2><a>About Mr.P</a></h2>
        <p>Mr.P, though young of age, has considerably old views on life(Old in the manner of it being shared by people from decades, sometimes centuries ago). Mr.P lives anonymously on the internet and has a very different and confirming demeanor offline. Consider this site as his mask that he wears out in public when he expresses his views.  </p>
        <h2><a >THE ABANDONMENT</a></h2>


<p>







We really do abadon a huge portion of our and our society's control to people we think are going to be good at handling them.

        <blockquote>
          <p> <em> &quot;When it comes down to it, government is simply an abandonment of responsibility on the assumption that there are people, other than ourselves, who really know how to manage things. But the government, run ostensibly for the good of the people, becomes a self-serving corporation. To keep things under control, it proliferates law of ever-increasing complexity and unintelligibility, and hinders productive work by demanding so much accounting on paper that the record of what has been done becomes more important than what has actually been done.&quot; </em> </p>
